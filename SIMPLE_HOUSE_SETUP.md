# üè† Simple House Setup Guide

**Setting up your house is now super easy!** Just follow these simple steps.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your House Description

Create a text file called `my_house.txt` and fill it out like this:

```
HOUSE SETUP FOR: YourCharacterName

MY HOUSE NAME: Your House Name

ROOMS IN MY HOUSE:
1. Room Name (description) - has: container1, container2, container3
2. Another Room (how to get here from room 1) - has: chest, bag
3. Third Room (how to get here) - has: vault, safe

HOW TO GET TO EACH ROOM:
- Room Name: starting room (where you enter the house)
- Another Room: from Room Name, go north
- Third Room: from Another Room, go up, then east
```

### Step 2: Real Example

Here's a real example for Malfian's Tower:

```
HOUSE SETUP FOR: Malfian

MY HOUSE NAME: Malfian's Tower

ROOMS IN MY HOUSE:
1. Main Hall (entrance room) - has: chest, cabinet, vault
2. Storage Room (upstairs) - has: bag, sack, barrel
3. Treasure Room (upper level north) - has: strongbox, safe
4. Workshop (basement east) - has: toolbox, crate

HOW TO GET TO EACH ROOM:
- Main Hall: starting room
- Storage Room: from Main Hall, go up
- Treasure Room: from Storage Room, go up, then north
- Workshop: from Main Hall, go down, then east
```

### Step 3: Let Us Convert It

1. Save your `my_house.txt` file
2. Run: `python house_converter.py my_house.txt`
3. The system automatically creates the technical files
4. Make sure your character is in `characters.csv` 
5. Your house is ready to scan with `--house` flag!
